Everything in Python is an object.

Object is a data structure, a way of storing information. And literal is a piece of syntax that creates an object. For example:

```py
"sushi"
```

When we encapsulate sushi with quotes, we create an object of `string` data type. A `string` is an immutable sequence of text characters.
